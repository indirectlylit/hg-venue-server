# Venue Server

This is our real-time visualization application. It takes data from our sensor network and renders it in real-time via a web server.


## Setting up the dev environment ##

### Virtual Machine ###

The application server should run on any OS: We leverage virtual machines to create a reproducible virtual machine.

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). This is the virtualization software that allows us easily set up and run a self-contained application server.
2. Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/). This wrapper software allows us to provision new virtual machines in a reproducible way.
3. Make sure you have git installed.
4. Clone this repository to your computer. For example: `git clone https://bitbucket.org/pedalpower/venue-server.git`


### Python Dependencies ###

We also have a python script which currently runs outside of the VM on the host. To run this, you'll need Python and a few libraries installed. You can either install these directly to your system's Python packages, or use [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) to keep them isolated.

Check that `python` and `pip` are installed by running from the command line:

    > python --version
    > pip --version

Next, in the `network_coordinator` directory, install the dependency libraries by running the following. (sudo is not necessary if using `virtualenv`)

    > sudo pip install -r requirements.txt




## Starting up the server

Open a terminal in the `venue_server` directory and run:

    > vagrant up

This may take a while the first time, as it is different from the docs_server virtual machine. We will need to manually start the server for this app. Once it is finished, you can ssh into the VM, which will be running in the background, by typing in:

    > vagrant ssh

Once you are on the virtual machine, you should see the terminal prompt change to `vagrant@precise32:~$`. You can now use this virtual machine environment to run the web server. The virtual machine (called the 'guest') will have a shared directory with the 'host' machine (your primary operating system). This is located at `/vagrant`, and the server's source code is at `/vagrant/src/`. Navigate there by typing:

    > cd /vagrant/src

Start the server with:

    > supervisor app.js


## Starting up logging script

Open a terminal in the `network_coordinator` directory. Run `logger.py` with `-h` for help:


    network_coordinator$ python logger.py -h
    Usage: logger.py [OPTIONS]

    Options:
      -h, --help   show this help message and exit
      -n NUMBER    Number of mutexed serial ports to cycle over. Default: 0 (for a
                   direct connection)
      -p PERIOD    Milliseconds to wait between each data request. Default: 100
      -l           Log data to a file.
      -v           Verbose: output all data to the console
      -s SIM_FILE  Replay a logged file


To 'simulate' or play back a data file logged earlier, run

    > python logger.py -vs sampleData.txt

For a single sensor node without the MUX:

    > python logger.py -v


You should see a combination of **-**, **R**, and **F** characters at the beginning of every data packet (delimited by `{...}`). An **R** means that the data is being fed to the server, and an **F** means that it's being logged to a file.



## Viewing the data


In your browser, navigate to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)


## Shutting Down

In the `venue_server` console:

    > exit
    > vagrant halt

And to stop the logger script, type `^C` (`Ctrl-C`)
