note -- 25w load is always on


==== test 1 ====

scenario:
 * basic step over 1V range at 25v w/ .2 interval & .2 hysteresis
 
 
first try, not all lights were working.


observations:
 * initial lightbulbs didn't present much difficulty
 * we were consiously trying to push the lightbulbs on as opposed to just pedalling normally and being braked
 

==== test 2 ====

scenario:
 * one big step
 * all 500watts on
 * hysteresis = 1v
 * on-threshold: 26v
 
 
observations:
 * no significant change in difficulty when all load is on
 * charge/discharge cycle seemed fast
 
 
==== test 3 ====

similar to 2 with 28v threshold and 3v hyst

 * no significant change in difficulty when all load is on again
 * we noticed that rate of charge was twice as fast for 25-26, and ~constant for 26-28

==== test 4 ====

same as 3 with 4v hyst

starting to feel a slight diff in resistance when lights are on.  not sure if its because of larger hyst or because we are getting tired
